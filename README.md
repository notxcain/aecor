# Aecor
### Typeful runtime for eventsourced behaviors

Aecor is an opinionated library to help building scalable, distributed eventsourced services written in Scala. It uses [Akka](https://github.com/akka/akka) for distribution and fault tolerance.
With the help of [Cats](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/) and [Shapeless](https://github.com/milessabin/shapeless) to reach type safety.

Aecor works on Scala 2.11 and 2.12 with Java 8.

The name `Aecor` (_lat. ocean_) is inspired by a vision of modern distributed applications, as an ocean of messages with pure behaviors floating in it.
